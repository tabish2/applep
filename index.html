                <h2>Hong Kong to ease coronavirus restrictions from Thursday</h2>
                <p>Hong Kong will ease strict coronavirus restrictions from Feb 18, re-opening sports and entertainment
                    facilities and extending dining hours, Health Secretary Sophia Chan has said, as daily cases in the
                    city dropped into single digits.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Chan, speaking at a news conference, said catering businesses would be able to operate until 10pm,
                    from 6pm now. Beauty salons, theme parks, cinemas and sports facilities would be allowed to resume,
                    with conditions in place.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    “We see there is room to gradually loosen social distancing measures,” she said, adding that
                    swimming pools, nightclubs and mahjong parlours would remain shut. A ban on gatherings of more than
                    two people in public places also remains in place.

                <p><br><br>
                    North Korea has attempted to steal Covid-19 vaccine technology by hacking Pfizer Inc according to
                    South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS), Yonhap news agency reported.
                    <br><br>
                    South Korea's Yonhap did not report when the alleged hacking took place or whether it was
                    successful, Reuters said.
                    <br><br>
                    Last year suspected North Korean hackers tried to break into at least nine health organisations,
                    including Johnson & Johnson , Novavax Inc, and AstraZeneca.
                    <br><br>
                    South Korea's intelligence agency said it had foiled North Korean attempts to hack into South Korean
                    companies developing coronavirus vaccines.

                <h2>Kazakhstan to roll out first locally produced Sputnik vaccine</h2>
                <p>Kazakhstan will be the first country in the world to locally produce Russia's Sputnik V coronavirus
                    vaccine, after a pharmaceutical company received government authorisation to make the jab, the
                    company said.
                    <br><br>
                    The company, called the Karaganda Pharmaceutical Complex (KPC), “was granted certification” to
                    produce the vaccine by Kazakhstan's health ministry on Monday, KPC said in a statement on the
                    Telegram messenger service.
                    <br><br>

                    A spokesman for the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which financed the development of the
                    two-dose jab, told AFP that Kazakhstan is the first country to begin local production of Sputnik V.
                    <br><br>

                    He said Brazil, India and South Korea are expected to follow.
